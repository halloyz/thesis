        <h1>Task 2</h1>
        <p>Good job! This time, the singer's voice will once again be moving.
            However, unlike the previous two tasks, there will be no checkpoints.
            Instead, the vocals will be coming directly from the destination, so 
            you will have to find your own path! As you get closer, the voice will
            sound less and less distant to indicate you are on the right track!</p>
        <p>Press "Start" whenever you are ready to proceed.</p>
