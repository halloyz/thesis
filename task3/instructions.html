        <h1>Task 3</h1>
        <p>Good job! This time, you will once again follow the singer's voice.
            However, unlike the previous two tasks, there will be no checkpoints.
            Instead, the vocals will be coming directly from the destination, so 
            you will have to find your own way there! (This means you may run into a dead end
            or two if you are unlucky!) As you get closer, the voice will
            sound less and less distant to indicate you are on the right track! </p>
        <p>Once again you will have unlimited time but if you still find the task too difficult, 
            you may press the "I give up" button and you will be guided by a map instead.</p>
        <p>Press "Start" whenever you are ready to proceed.</p>
