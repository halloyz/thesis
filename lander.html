        <h2>A virtual experiment by Daniel Estehghari for the University of Copenhagen.</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Welcome! In this experiment, you will get to test a brand new kind of navigation experience (in a simulated environment). Instead of looking at a map, you will follow the sound of
    the music to find your destination.
    There will be 3 navigation tasks for you to complete. Afterwards you will answer a few questions about your experience. In each of the three tasks, 
    a different method will be used to guide you along to your destination; the goal is to evaluate which method works better, so please pay attention to how you experienced
    each of the three tasks!
    Before starting, please make sure that:</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>You are sitting comfortably at a laptop or desktop computer (not a phone/tablet).</li>
        <li>You have a pair of headphones connected (any headphones will do).</li>
        <li>You have approximately 30 minutes of undisturbed time to complete the experiment.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>


    <p>If you are ready, please input your first and last name together (no space inbetween)
     to move on to the first task. Your data will be handled anonymously.</p>
