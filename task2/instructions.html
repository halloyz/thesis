        <h1>Task 2</h1>
        <p>Good job! This time, only the vocals of the song will change as you move around.
            In other words: follow the singer's voice! When you have reached your destination you will automatically be redirected to the final task.
        You will once again have unlimited time but if you find the task is impossible, press the "I give up" button and a map will guide you instead.
    </p>
        <p>Press "Start" whenever you are ready to proceed.</p>
