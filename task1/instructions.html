        <h1>Task 1</h1>
        <p>In this task, your goal is to navigate to an unknown destination in Fredriksberg, Copenhagen, by following the sound of the music. To change your position, use the arrow keys on your keyboard. (You can also click the yellow arrows at the bottom of the screen.)
        To rotate the view, click and drag with your mouse. If you have used Google Street View before, the controls will be familiar.
        The sound will start at one checkpoint some distance away from you, and move to the next checkpoint when you get closer. To detect from where the sound is coming you will have to "move your head" (by clicking and dragging) and listen carefully.
        </p>
        <p>
        When you have reached the secret destination, you will automatically be redirected to the next task. You will have unlimited time, so no stress. If you however feel the task is impossible, press the "I give up" button and a map will guide you instead.
        </p>
        <p>Press "Start" whenever you are ready to proceed.</p>
