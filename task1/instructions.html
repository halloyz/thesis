        <h1>Task 1</h1>
        <p>In this task, your goal is to navigate to an unknown destination by following the sound of the music. 
        The sound will start at one checkpoint some distance away from you, and move to the next checkpoint when you get closer. The process will be repeated
        until you have reached your target. Good luck!
        </p>
        <p>Press "Start" whenever you are ready to proceed.</p>
